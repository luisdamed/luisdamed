### Hi there, I'm Luis

I'm a Lifelong Student, Engineer, and Maker! 

I'm experienced in MATLAB, and have used it mostly for mechanical/automotive computations, but also some other scientific work (Particulate Matter, Air Filtration and Air Quality)

Iâ€™m currently learning more and more about Python, and Data Analytics tools, like SQL, and Tableu.

I also have done a couple of projects with C/C++ using microcontrollers and sensors.

#### I have a website where I post - not so regularly - about what I learn and things I make. Check it out: [makerluis.com](makerluis.com)
